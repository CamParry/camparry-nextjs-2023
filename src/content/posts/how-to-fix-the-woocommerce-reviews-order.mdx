Last week I was building a wordpress site for a client using woocommerce, and in
the process of setting up the customer reviews section on the product page I
noticed that by default the reviews were being displayed with the oldest first,
but I wanted to show the latest reviews at the top.

I thought this would be simple to fix as reviews are just comments under the
hood so the order can be changed in the WordPress discussion settings page by
editing the comments display order. However, annoyingly I found out this doesn't
actually change the order of all the reviews, just the order on each page, so if
you have 4 pages each with 10 reviews the the first review that is shown is the
10th oldest review, which makes even less sense.

Luckily there is an easy fix, you just need to hook into the
`comments_template_query_args` filter and change the orderby and order
arguments, behind the scenes this is then used in the `comments_template()`
function to override the arguments passed to the comments query. You can do this
by adding the following code snippet into your theme's functions.php file.

```php
function cp_comment_order($args)
{
    $args['orderby'] = 'comment_date_gmt';
    $args['order'] = 'DESC';
    return $args;
}
add_filter('comments_template_query_args', 'cp_comment_order');
```

It's worth noting that this will also effect the normal comments order.
