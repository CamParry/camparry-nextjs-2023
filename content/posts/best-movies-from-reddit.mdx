I often find myself wondering what movie to watch, and usually in the moment I
just click on whatever is on the homepage of Netflix or pick a film that I've
already watched a bunch of times. So in an attempt to expand my horizons, I
decided to compile a list of movies based on the number of times they were
recommended on the r/movies subreddit.

More specifically, I did a Google search for "best movies reddit", opened the
first 7 links, found the 32 most upvoted comments, and added them to a list. I
then normalised the movie names to correct for naming inconsistencies and
created a small script to count and then sort the movies by frequency. Once this
was done, I had a list of 344 movies, which I then trimmed down to 103 by just
keeping the films with more than 2 recommendations.

You can probably tell, but this is a pretty basic way of compiling a list, and
there is room for error, so I don't claim in any way that this list is totally
accurate, but it's a good starting place.

I have already watched some of these films, and as I watch more, I will mark
them off with the goal of watching them all, albeit without committing to a
particular time frame.

So without further ado, here's the list of 103 movies, sorted by number of
recommendations:
