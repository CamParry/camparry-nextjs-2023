## Welcome

Hey there, welcome to my new website! After messing around with redesigns for
the last two years, I finally got my act together and relaunched it with a new
design and a focus shift towards posting regular content. I’m hoping that this
change pushes me to write more about the things I learn on my web development
journey, as well as share my general thoughts on life.

## Goals for the site

My main goal for this site is to increase the amount of content I create and put
out into the world. Most of my working days are spent building projects for
clients, and along the way, I'm constantly learning new and interesting things.
However, these learnings usually just end up stored in my head, with the
occasional contribution on Stack Overflow. Since I spend considerable time
learning, it feels wasteful not to record it. Going forward, my aim is to share
these learnings in a more permanent and refined manner on this blog. This will
also serve as a good reference for my future self when I inevitably need to use
something that I learned a year prior and have forgotten.

## Credit where it’s due

I have to acknowledge the inspiration I took from seeing
[Josh Comeau’s](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) great website, he’s an excellent
writer and teacher and I’ve learnt a lot from reading his blog over the last
year or two.

## The nerdy stuff

For those who are interested in the technical side of things, I used the
following tools to create this site:

-   Framework: NextJS 18 (no app directory yet)
-   Language: Typescript
-   Styling: Tailwind ❤️
-   Animations: Framer Motion (for page transitions)
-   Database: PlanetScale + Prisma (for keeping track of post likes)
-   Content: MDX Files
-   Hosting: Vercel

I have a handful of other ideas to extend this site over time, but for now
that’s it, nice and simple!
